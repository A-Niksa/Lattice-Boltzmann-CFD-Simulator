# Lattice-Boltzmann-CFD-Simulator
This project simulates fluid flow in a 2D channel with periodic boundary conditions. The method used for achieving the objective of this project is the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).
ACLNOWLEDGEMENT: This project is based off pcomz's LBM repository (https://github.com/pmocz/latticeboltzmann-python).
